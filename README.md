# WSU-Web-Design-System

## Getting Started
All use-ready components are located in `components/dist/<component-name>`. Any development work on components should be done in `components/src/<component-name>`. 

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
3. Build away!

## Local Development
- For local development of components: `npm run start`
- For building component parts (html, css, js): `npm run build:partials`
- TODO: Add ability to build for packages (global, site, content, etc.): `npm run build:packages`
- TODO: Add ability to build all (packages and parts): `npm run build:all`
