# WSU Web Design System
We aim to create a more beautiful, accessible, and usable web pressence for the WSU System. Storybook will define all of the unique components, page templates, and design tokens available for the WSU System to adopt and use in their own web sites and applications.

## Storybook
### Components

Components are the discrete, usable react components to build and create websites in the WSU Web Design System.

### Elements

Elements defines a consistent pallete of typography, colors, spacing, and other various elements of style that are implemented through the design system.

### Enrollment Management (EM)

EM defines an area of components that are strictly being developed to serve the new student audience. These components should not be used outside of communicating to students about coming to WSU.

### Pages

Pages defines an area where we can build components and implement them in a way to see how they interact with others.

## Component Status

Component status will be updated periodically to indicate the current state of each component in storybook. Currently four main status are in place:

- **In Development** - This component is either in active development or has a ways to go before feedback will be valuable. Anything in this status is likely to change. 
- **Needs Feedback** - This component is nearing deployment and needs any, and all, feedback to finalize before being deployed.
- **Stable** - This component has received at least one round of feedback and is in a "production ready", usable state. 
- **Needs Deployment** - Primarily for the web team to track which components are stable, but not yet deployed to their respective WP implementations (WSUWP Blocks, WSU WDS Theme, etc.)
- **Has Known Issues** - We're aware of existing issues with the component and are working towards fixing it in the future.

## Feedback
We are always looking for constructive feedback with regards to the WSU WDS. Please click the feedback icon <Icon name="feedback" /> in the top toolbar, which will open a new window for you to provide feedback on any specific element of the Design System.
