# WSU Web Design System
We aim to create a more beautiful, accessible, and usable web pressence for the WSU System. Storybook will define all of the unique components, page templates, and design tokens available for the WSU System to adopt and use in their own web sites and applications.

## Storybook
### Components

Components are the discrete, usable react components to build and create websites in the WSU Web Design System.

### Elements

Elements defines a consistent pallete of typography, colors, spacing, and other various elements of style that are implemented through the design system.

### Enrollment Management (EM)

EM defines an area of components that are strictly being developed to serve the new student audience. These components should not be used outside of communicating to students about coming to WSU.

### Pages

Pages defines an area where we can build components and implement them in a way to see how they interact with others.

## Feedback
We are always looking for constructive feedback with regards to the WSU WDS. Please click the feedback icon <Icon name="feedback" /> in the top toolbar, which will open a new window for you to provide feedback on any specific element of the Design System.
